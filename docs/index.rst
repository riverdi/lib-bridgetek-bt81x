*****

Bridgetek BT81x series of Embedded Video Engines (EVE) utilizes an object oriented methodology for creating hi-quality human machine interfaces (HMIs). With support for display, audio, and touch, this new technology allows engineers to quickly and efficiently design HMIs and deliver robust solutions, hi-resolution displays with lower bill of material costs.

Technical Details
=================

* BT81x functionality includes graphic control, audio control, and touch control interface
* Support multiple widgets for simplified design implementation
* Support Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) format to save considerable memory space for larger fonts and graphics images
* Support external QSPI NOR flash to fetch graphic elements (image, font, widget etc)
* Support 4-wire resistive touch screen (BT816)
* Support capacitive touch screen with up to 5 touches detection (BT815)
* Hardware engine can recognize touch tags and track touch movement. Provides notification for up to 255 touch tags.
* Programmable interrupt controller provides interrupts to host MCU
* Built-in 12MHz crystal oscillator with PLL providing programmable system clock up to 72MHz
* Video RGB parallel output; configurable to support PCLK up to 60MHz and R/G/B output of 1 to 8 bits
* Programmable timing to adjust HSYNC and VSYNC timing, enabling interface to numerous displays
* Support for LCD display with resolution up to SVGA (800×600) and formats with data enable (DE) mode or VSYNC/HSYNC mode
* Support landscape and portrait orientations
* Display enable control output to LCD panel
* Integrated 1MByte graphics RAM, no frame buffer RAM required
* Support playback of motion-JPEG encoded AVI videos
* Built-in sound synthesizer
